# Simple CTF

## 1.Enumeration 

Let's start with a simple scanning ports tool such as Nmap.
```
nmap -sV -A -Pn 10.10.123.79                                                                                1 âš™

Okay, we have ftp with anonymous login enable, http and ssh running on 2222 port, nice try.

## 2. Searching in FTP

Let's log in as anonymous in ftp and see what we can find out.

We found out there is a txt file for Mitch. By the way, FTP is configured as extended passive mode, that means it'll took a while to connect. Lets see what is inside that txt file:

Okay, it seems there is a weak password out there that we can crack easily. We'll find out later on, i guess.

## 3. Cracking with Hydra

Okay, we found that there's a weak password for the user called "mitch". That give us enough clues to try to brute force the ssh password for mitch's account.

After a while, we found out the password!!
* * *
## 4. Getting into SSH

Lets login with the ssh's credentials we already have:

We are logged in and we can get the user flag. Just like that.
* * *
## 5. Privileges Escalation

We can run vim with sudo privileges. That give us an enourmos advantage.

Let's find out what GTFObins have to say about vim:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99112106/174273761-1ca0a4da-5834-4942-9e04-a04c1b51fd7c.png)

Okay, let's give that a try! 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99112106/174273795-f2a08f6b-3341-4f0e-aeb1-b1fb198bc4d7.png)

That worked!! So now we're root and we can pull out the last flag.
